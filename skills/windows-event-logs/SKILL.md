# Windows Event Logs — detection authoring

This skill encodes the Windows-native event log knowledge required for detection content that depends on Security, Sysmon, PowerShell, or System event channels. It bridges the gap between raw Windows telemetry and the platform-specific query skills used by your SIEM or EDR.

---

## 1. Event channel landscape

| Channel | Log name | Key content |
|---|---|---|
| **Security** | `Security` | Authentication, process creation, object access, policy changes, account management |
| **Sysmon** | `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` | Process creation with hashes, network connections, file creation, registry, DNS, WMI, named pipes, clipboard |
| **PowerShell** | `Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational` | ScriptBlock logging (4104), Module logging (4103) |
| **System** | `System` | Service installation (7045), driver loads, system state |
| **Windows Defender** | `Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational` | AV detections, exclusion changes, tamper events |
| **Task Scheduler** | `Microsoft-Windows-TaskScheduler/Operational` | Scheduled task creation/modification/execution |
| **WMI** | `Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity/Operational` | WMI subscription events |
| **AppLocker** | `Microsoft-Windows-AppLocker/*` | Application execution control |
| **NTLM** | `Microsoft-Windows-NTLM/Operational` | NTLM authentication events (requires audit policy) |

---

## 2. Critical Security Event IDs

### Authentication

| EID | Description | Detection use |
|---|---|---|
| **4624** | Successful logon | Lateral movement (Type 3/10), service logon (Type 5), interactive (Type 2) |
| **4625** | Failed logon | Brute force, password spray |
| **4648** | Explicit credential logon | Credential use with alternate identity (runas, PsExec) |
| **4634** / **4647** | Logoff | Session duration analysis |
| **4672** | Special privileges assigned | Privileged logon detection |
| **4768** | Kerberos TGT request | Kerberoasting (RC4 encryption type 0x17) |
| **4769** | Kerberos service ticket request | Kerberoasting, service access |
| **4771** | Kerberos pre-auth failed | Password spray against Kerberos |
| **4776** | NTLM credential validation | NTLM relay, pass-the-hash |

**Logon Type reference** (EID 4624/4625):

| Type | Name | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | Interactive | Console logon |
| 3 | Network | SMB, WinRM, mapped drives |
| 4 | Batch | Scheduled tasks |
| 5 | Service | Service start |
| 7 | Unlock | Workstation unlock |
| 8 | NetworkCleartext | IIS basic auth, PowerShell remoting with CredSSP |
| 9 | NewCredentials | `runas /netonly` |
| 10 | RemoteInteractive | RDP |
| 11 | CachedInteractive | Cached domain credentials |

### Process creation

| EID | Description | Detection use |
|---|---|---|
| **4688** | Process creation | Command-line logging (requires audit policy + GPO) |

**Critical prerequisite**: Process command-line logging is **not enabled by default**. Requires:
- Audit Policy: `Audit Process Creation` → Success
- GPO: `Include command line in process creation events` → Enabled

Without this, EID 4688 contains the process name but **no command line** — most detection value is lost.

### Account management

| EID | Description | Detection use |
|---|---|---|
| **4720** | User account created | Persistence, backdoor accounts |
| **4722** | User account enabled | Re-enabled dormant accounts |
| **4724** | Password reset attempt | Credential manipulation |
| **4728** / **4732** / **4756** | Member added to security group | Privilege escalation |
| **4738** | User account changed | Account property manipulation |
| **4740** | Account locked out | Brute force indicator |

### Object access and file shares

| EID | Description | Detection use |
|---|---|---|
| **4663** | Object access attempt | File/registry access auditing |
| **5140** | Network share accessed | Lateral movement via SMB |
| **5145** | Network share object checked | Detailed share access (file-level) |

### Service and scheduled task

| EID | Description | Detection use |
|---|---|---|
| **7045** (System) | Service installed | Persistence, PsExec, lateral movement |
| **4697** (Security) | Service installed (Security log) | Same as 7045, different channel |
| **4698** | Scheduled task created | Persistence |
| **4702** | Scheduled task updated | Persistence modification |

### Policy and privilege

| EID | Description | Detection use |
|---|---|---|
| **4703** | Token right adjusted | Privilege escalation |
| **4719** | Audit policy changed | Defence impairment |
| **1102** | Audit log cleared | Anti-forensics |

---

## 3. Sysmon Event IDs

Sysmon provides richer telemetry than native Security events but requires deployment and configuration.

| EID | Description | Detection use |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | Process creation (with hashes, parent, command line) | Primary process detection |
| **2** | File creation time changed | Timestomping |
| **3** | Network connection | Outbound C2, lateral movement |
| **5** | Process terminated | Process lifecycle |
| **6** | Driver loaded | Rootkit, vulnerable driver (BYOVD) |
| **7** | Image loaded (DLL) | DLL side-loading, injection |
| **8** | CreateRemoteThread | Process injection |
| **9** | RawAccessRead | Direct disk access (credential theft) |
| **10** | ProcessAccess | LSASS access (credential dumping) |
| **11** | FileCreate | Payload drops, staging |
| **12/13/14** | Registry events | Persistence, configuration changes |
| **15** | FileCreateStreamHash | ADS (Alternate Data Streams) |
| **17/18** | Pipe created/connected | Named pipe C2 (Cobalt Strike, Metasploit) |
| **19/20/21** | WMI events | WMI persistence |
| **22** | DNS query | C2 domain resolution, DGA |
| **23** | FileDelete (archived) | Deleted file capture |
| **24** | Clipboard change | Clipboard monitoring |
| **25** | Process tampering | Process hollowing, herpaderping |
| **26** | FileDeleteDetected | File deletion without archive |
| **27** | FileBlockExecutable | Executable blocked |
| **28** | FileBlockShredding | Shredding blocked |
| **29** | FileExecutableDetected | Executable file detected |

### Sysmon configuration discipline

- **Never deploy default Sysmon config in production.** The default logs everything and overwhelms storage.
- Use community-maintained configs (SwiftOnSecurity, Olaf Hartong) as a **starting point**, then tune.
- **Exclude high-volume legitimate processes** via `<RuleGroup>` exclusions — but document every exclusion.
- **Hash algorithms**: configure `SHA256` minimum. `MD5` alone is insufficient for modern threat intel.
- **LSASS protection** (EID 10): filter `TargetImage` to `lsass.exe` only — unfiltered ProcessAccess is extremely noisy.

---

## 4. PowerShell logging

| Feature | Event ID | Channel | Prerequisite |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ScriptBlock logging** | 4104 | PowerShell Operational | GPO: `Turn on PowerShell Script Block Logging` |
| **Module logging** | 4103 | PowerShell Operational | GPO: `Turn on Module Logging` (specify modules) |
| **Transcription** | — | File-based | GPO: `Turn on PowerShell Transcription` |

**ScriptBlock logging (4104)** is the highest-value PowerShell telemetry:
- Captures the **deobfuscated** script content (after PowerShell's own parsing)
- Captures scripts loaded via `-EncodedCommand`, `Invoke-Expression`, `Add-Type`
- Warning level 3 = suspicious (automatic for known-bad patterns)

**Detection patterns**:
- Base64-decoded content containing `WebClient`, `DownloadString`, `IEX`
- AMSI bypass attempts (`AmsiUtils`, `amsiInitFailed`)
- Reflection-based .NET calls (`[System.Reflection.Assembly]::Load`)
- Credential access (`Get-Credential`, `ConvertTo-SecureString` with plaintext)

---

## 5. Audit policy prerequisites

Detection content must declare which audit policies are required. Without the correct policy, the events simply do not generate.

| Category | Subcategory | Required for |
|---|---|---|
| Account Logon | Credential Validation | 4776 (NTLM) |
| Account Logon | Kerberos Authentication Service | 4768, 4771 |
| Account Logon | Kerberos Service Ticket Operations | 4769 |
| Logon/Logoff | Logon | 4624, 4625 |
| Logon/Logoff | Special Logon | 4672 |
| Object Access | File Share | 5140, 5145 |
| Object Access | Detailed File Share | 5145 (file-level) |
| Detailed Tracking | Process Creation | 4688 |
| Account Management | User Account Management | 4720, 4722, 4724, 4738 |
| Account Management | Security Group Management | 4728, 4732, 4756 |
| Policy Change | Audit Policy Change | 4719 |
| System | Security System Extension | 4697 |

**Rule**: Every detection that depends on a specific Event ID must document the audit policy prerequisite. A detection for EID 5145 that doesn't mention "Detailed File Share auditing required" will silently fail in environments without it.

---

## 6. SIEM ingestion patterns

> Table/index names are SIEM-specific. Consult your SIEM's Windows event integration documentation for exact table names and field mappings.

| Windows source | Telemetry type | Ingestion method | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Security log | Authentication, process, account management events | Windows Event Forwarding (WEF), SIEM agent, or EDR sensor | Primary detection source |
| Sysmon | Process, file, network, registry, DNS, pipe events | WEF or SIEM agent (Sysmon channel) | Requires Sysmon deployment + config |
| PowerShell Operational | ScriptBlock (4104), Module (4103) logging | WEF or SIEM agent | Requires GPO enablement |
| System | Service installation (7045), driver loads | WEF or SIEM agent | Always available |
| Windows Defender Operational | AV detections, exclusion changes, tamper events | WEF or SIEM agent | Always available on Windows 10+ |
| Task Scheduler Operational | Scheduled task lifecycle | WEF or SIEM agent | Always available |

### EDR sensor overlap with Sysmon

Modern EDR sensors (Defender, CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, Carbon Black, etc.) provide **native sensor telemetry** that overlaps significantly with Sysmon for process, file, and network events. In EDR-managed environments, Sysmon may be partially redundant. However, Sysmon provides unique value for:
- **Named pipe events** (EID 17/18) — limited or no EDR equivalent
- **WMI subscription events** (EID 19/20/21) — partial EDR coverage
- **Clipboard monitoring** (EID 24) — no EDR equivalent
- **DNS query logging** (EID 22) — EDR coverage varies in granularity
- **File creation time changes** (EID 2) — timestomping detection

---

## 7. Event data structure

Windows events store structured data in XML format within the `EventData` or `UserData` element. Key extraction considerations:

### Common EventData fields by EID

| EID | Key fields | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 4624 | `TargetUserName`, `TargetDomainName`, `LogonType`, `IpAddress`, `IpPort`, `WorkstationName` | Logon Type is critical for filtering |
| 4625 | `TargetUserName`, `LogonType`, `FailureReason`, `Status`, `SubStatus`, `IpAddress` | Status/SubStatus codes identify failure reason |
| 4688 | `NewProcessName`, `CommandLine`, `ParentProcessName`, `TokenElevationType` | CommandLine requires GPO enablement |
| 4720 | `TargetUserName`, `TargetDomainName`, `SubjectUserName` | Who created which account |
| 7045 | `ServiceName`, `ImagePath`, `ServiceType`, `StartType`, `AccountName` | Service binary path is key detection field |
| 4104 | `ScriptBlockText`, `ScriptBlockId`, `Path` | Deobfuscated script content |

### Extraction guidance

- **Prefer pre-parsed fields** when your SIEM provides them — XML parsing is expensive at query time.
- **Fall back to XML extraction** only when the SIEM does not pre-parse the needed field.
- **Field positions in XML are not guaranteed** across Windows versions — extract by field name, not array index.
- Consult your SIEM's documentation for which EventData fields are pre-parsed into dedicated columns.

## 8. ETW (Event Tracing for Windows) fundamentals

ETW is the underlying mechanism that generates all Windows events. Understanding ETW is relevant for advanced detection and evasion awareness.

### How events flow

```
Application / kernel → ETW Provider → ETW Session → Event Log channel → EVTX file → SIEM
```

### Detection-relevant ETW concepts

| Concept | Relevance |
|---|---|
| **ETW providers** | Each event source registers as a provider (e.g., `Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing`). Attackers may attempt to disable or patch providers. |
| **ETW patching** | Attackers can patch `ntdll!EtwEventWrite` in-process to blind ETW-based telemetry (including AMSI). Detection: monitor for `ntdll.dll` memory modifications. |
| **ETW session limits** | Windows has a maximum of 64 concurrent ETW sessions. Exhausting sessions can blind security tools. |
| **Provider GUIDs** | Each provider has a GUID. Sysmon's provider GUID is well-known — attackers may specifically target it. |
| **Kernel-mode ETW** | Some events (e.g., process creation, image loads) originate from kernel-mode providers and are harder to tamper with from user-mode. |

### Defence impairment via ETW

| Attack | Detection signal |
|---|---|
| ETW provider patching | Sysmon EID 10 (ProcessAccess to `ntdll.dll`), or EDR-specific tamper alerts |
| Audit log cleared | Security EID 1102 |
| Audit policy changed | Security EID 4719 |
| Sysmon service stopped | System EID 7036 (Sysmon service state change) |
| Event log service stopped | System EID 7036 (EventLog service state change) |

---

## 9. Windows Defender Operational events

| EID | Description | Detection use |
|---|---|---|
| **1116** | Malware detected | AV detection — correlate with process context |
| **1117** | Action taken on malware | AV remediation action |
| **5001** | Real-time protection disabled | Defence impairment |
| **5007** | Configuration changed | Exclusion added, settings weakened |
| **5010** | Scanning disabled | Defence impairment |
| **1121** | ASR rule triggered (block mode) | Attack Surface Reduction detection |
| **1122** | ASR rule triggered (audit mode) | ASR detection in audit mode |

**Key detection**: EID 5007 with exclusion path additions is a common attacker technique to blind Defender before deploying payloads. Monitor for exclusion changes targeting sensitive paths (`C:\Windows\Temp`, `C:\Users\*\AppData`, etc.).

---

## 10. Detection anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Description | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Assuming command-line logging is enabled** | Writing 4688 detections without noting the GPO prerequisite | Document the prerequisite; provide a validation query |
| **Sysmon without config declaration** | Referencing Sysmon EIDs without specifying which config rules must be active | Declare required Sysmon config rules |
| **Logon Type confusion** | Alerting on all 4624 events without filtering by Logon Type | Filter to relevant types (3, 10 for lateral movement) |
| **Machine account noise** | Not excluding `$`-suffixed accounts from authentication detections | Filter out accounts ending in `$` (machine accounts) |
| **Service account noise** | Not excluding known service accounts from logon anomaly detections | Maintain exclusion list with audit trail |
| **EID 4688 without parent process** | Missing the parent process context that Sysmon EID 1 provides natively | Use Sysmon EID 1 or EDR process creation telemetry for parent chain |
